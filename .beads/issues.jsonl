{"id":"textpixel-5ir","title":"Research WebGL/WebGPU feasibility for TextPixel","description":"## Research Findings: WebGL vs WebGPU for TextPixel\n\n### TextPixel Requirements\n- **Encode**: Map characters (ASCII 32-126) to RGB colors using one of 4 algorithms (HSL, RGB, Semantic, Frequency)\n- **Decode**: Reverse lookup - find nearest character for each RGB pixel (95 possible colors per algorithm)\n- **Data size**: Images can be up to several thousand pixels (e.g., 1000x1000 = 1M pixels)\n- **Algorithms**: HSL conversion, modular arithmetic, conditional logic based on character ranges\n\n### Recommendation: WebGL 2.0\n\n**Why WebGL over WebGPU:**\n\n1. **Browser Support**: WebGL 2.0 has 92% browser support (all major browsers since 2022). WebGPU just reached all major browsers in late 2025 but mobile/Linux support is still incomplete.\n\n2. **Sufficient for Use Case**: TextPixel operations are simple parallel pixel operations (no complex compute graphs). Fragment shaders in WebGL can handle:\n   - Per-pixel color calculations (encode)\n   - Per-pixel color matching (decode with texture lookup)\n\n3. **Simpler Implementation**: WebGL is more mature with better documentation and examples for this exact use case (texture-based GPGPU).\n\n4. **No Blocking Needed**: For TextPixel's scale (typically \u003c1M pixels), WebGL performance is adequate and the extra complexity of WebGPU compute shaders isn't justified.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\n**Encode (charToColor):**\n- Upload text as a 1D texture (character codes as pixel values)\n- Fragment shader reads character code, computes RGB using selected algorithm\n- Output to canvas\n\n**Decode (colorToChar):**\n- Pre-compute 95-color lookup table as texture\n- Fragment shader samples image, finds nearest color in lookup texture\n- Read back result (this step is inherently slow but unavoidable)\n\n### Performance Expectations\n- Encode: Near-instant for any reasonable text size\n- Decode: 10-100x faster than current chunked CPU approach for large images\n\n### Future Consideration\nIf TextPixel expands to support larger datasets or more complex algorithms, WebGPU could be revisited. The current architecture should make migration straightforward since both use similar shader concepts.","status":"closed","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"githubwho@gmail.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T11:22:25.043695179-08:00","created_by":"who","updated_at":"2026-01-15T11:27:02.789245542-08:00","closed_at":"2026-01-15T11:27:02.789245542-08:00","close_reason":"Research complete: Recommending WebGL 2.0 over WebGPU for better browser support (92%) while meeting performance needs.
